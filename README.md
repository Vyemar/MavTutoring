- **Performance**: Ensures fast load times and minimal latency.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ethyn-N/bugHouse.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   For backend:

   ```bash
   cd bugHouse/backend
   npm install
   ```

   For frontend:

   ```bash
   cd bugHouse/frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd bugHouse/backend
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server on port 4000 as configured in your .env file.

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd bugHouse/frontend
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the React development server on port 3000, and open the application in your default web browser.

3. (Optional) Create an admin user:

   If your application requires an initial admin account, run the createAdmin.js script after the backend server is running:

   ```bash
   node .\createAdmin.js
   ```

   This script is in the bugHouse/backend directory and will create an admin account with email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'adminpassword'. Make sure MongoDB is accessible before running this script.

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set up the required environment variables before running the application:

1. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

   ```
   # MongoDB Connection URI
   DB=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

   # Backend Configuration
   BACKEND_PORT=4000
   BACKEND_HOST=localhost
   PROTOCOL=http

   # Frontend Configuration
   FRONTEND_PORT=3000
   FRONTEND_HOST=localhost

   # Session Secret for Cookies or JWT
   SESSION_SECRET=<your-secure-random-session-secret>

   # SMTP Configuration (Email Service)
   SMTP_SERVER=<your-smtp-server>
   SMTP_PORT=<your-smtp-port>
   SMTP_USERNAME=<your-smtp-username>
   SMTP_PASSWORD=<your-smtp-password>
   SMTP_PROXY_EMAIL=<your-proxy-sender-email>
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
   ```
   REACT_APP_PROTOCOL=http
   HTTPS=false
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_HOST=localhost
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT=4000
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when running the application:

- Check that all dependencies are installed correctly
- Verify that MongoDB is running and accessible
- Ensure that environment variables are set correctly
- Check the console for error messages
